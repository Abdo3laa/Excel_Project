# Excel Project Description
Part 1: Data Cleaning and Standardization
In the first part of my Excel project, I meticulously cleaned and standardized the dataset to ensure accuracy and consistency. This involved several key steps:

Removed Empty Rows: Eliminated any rows in the spreadsheet that did not contain data, ensuring a clean dataset for analysis.
Removed Duplicates: Identified and removed duplicate entries to maintain data integrity and prevent redundancy.
Checked and Fixed Spelling Mistakes: Conducted a thorough spell-check across all data fields and corrected any spelling errors found, ensuring uniformity in the dataset.
Removed Extra Spaces: Trimmed leading, trailing, and excessive spaces within cells to streamline data entry and enhance readability.
Part 2: Data Analysis and Visualization
The second part of my Excel project focused on transforming the cleaned dataset into insightful visualizations and summaries using Excel's powerful features:

Formatted Data as a Table: Structured the data into a table format to facilitate easy sorting, filtering, and analysis.

Utilized AutoSum for Calculations: Applied Excel's AutoSum feature to compute essential metrics such as Sum, Average, Minimum, Maximum, and Count for relevant data fields.

Created Pivot Tables: Generated three distinct Pivot Tables, each tailored to highlight specific aspects of the dataset:

Pivot Table 1:

Displayed the Department field in the Rows section and Equipment Count in the Values section.
Summarized the total equipment count by department.
Sorted the table in descending order based on the sum of equipment count.
Pivot Table 2:

Included the Equipment Class field below the Department field.
Organized vehicle types under each department with their respective counts.
Collapsed all fields except for the top one (Transportation), focusing on detailed breakdowns within this category.
Pivot Table 3:

Placed the Equipment Class field above the Department field.
Listed vehicle types first, followed by departments and their respective counts.
Collapsed all fields except for the top one (CUV), emphasizing detailed insights within this specific vehicle type.
These meticulously crafted Pivot Tables not only visualize but also effectively summarize the dataset, providing clear insights into equipment distribution across departments and vehicle types. This comprehensive approach ensures that the data is not only clean and standardized but also highly actionable for decision-making purposes.
