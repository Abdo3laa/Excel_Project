# Comprehensive Excel Project

## Part 1: Data Cleaning and Standardization
In the initial phase of this Excel project, the dataset was meticulously cleaned and standardized to ensure accuracy and consistency. Key steps included:

- **Removed Empty Rows:** Eliminated rows without data to maintain a clean dataset for analysis.
- **Removed Duplicates:** Identified and removed duplicate entries to uphold data integrity and prevent redundancy.
- **Checked and Fixed Spelling Errors:** Performed a thorough spell-check across all data fields and corrected any errors, ensuring uniformity.
- **Removed Extra Spaces:** Trimmed leading, trailing, and excessive spaces within cells to streamline data entry and enhance readability.

## Part 2: Data Analysis and Visualization
The second phase focused on transforming the cleaned dataset into meaningful visualizations and summaries using Excel's features:

- **Formatted Data as a Table:** Structured the data into a table format to facilitate easy sorting, filtering, and analysis.
- **Utilized AutoSum for Calculations:** Applied Excel's AutoSum feature to compute essential metrics such as Sum, Average, Minimum, Maximum, and Count for relevant data fields.

### Pivot Tables
Three distinct Pivot Tables were created to highlight specific aspects of the dataset:

- **Pivot Table 1:** 
  - **Fields:** Department (Rows), Equipment Count (Values)
  - **Summary:** Summarized total equipment count by department. Sorted in descending order based on the sum of equipment count.

- **Pivot Table 2:** 
  - **Fields:** Equipment Class (Below Department), Department (Rows)
  - **Summary:** Organized vehicle types under each department with their respective counts. Collapsed all fields except for the top one (Transportation), focusing on detailed breakdowns within this category.

- **Pivot Table 3:** 
  - **Fields:** Equipment Class (Above Department), Department (Rows)
  - **Summary:** Listed vehicle types first, followed by departments and their respective counts. Collapsed all fields except for the top one (CUV), emphasizing detailed insights within this specific vehicle type.

These meticulously crafted Pivot Tables not only visualize but also effectively summarize the dataset, providing clear insights into equipment distribution across departments and vehicle types. This comprehensive approach ensures that the data is clean, standardized, and actionable for informed decision-making.
